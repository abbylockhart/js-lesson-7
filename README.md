# CLG ASSIGNMENT 7
Lesson 7 - Javascript

INSTRUCTIONS
Using an object literal, declare several new objects for your website

List out properties and methods for your new objects. Start off by including different data types in your properties

Then write functions that will act as your object methods

Now begin fetching data from your objects to be used in your pre-existing functions from previous assignments

You can even fetch pieces of property data from an object and use it in the same object method(s)

Use dot notation to to access and perform the object methods you have now created

Fetch some of your new object property data and use it in some of your DOM manipulation functions

Experiment with null and undefined data types with your objects

As an added bonus: Use ‘this’ keyword in at least one method

As an added added bonus: play around with parsing JSON and JavaScript
(Hint: JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() will help you here)
